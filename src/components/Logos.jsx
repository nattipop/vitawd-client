      <h3 className="website-page-headers">Meeting</h3>
      <p className="website-page-p">With something as specific and crucial to your business as a logo, it is important for me to meet with you either in-person or over the phone. This leaves room for questions both ways and establishes good communication from the start - So give me a call!</p>
      <h3 className="website-page-headers">Price</h3>
      <p className="website-page-p">My base price for a logo is $300 with $150 of that required up-front. Variations will be $100/each. You will receive the rights to your logo along with .jpeg and .png files of your logo.</p>
      <h3 className="website-page-headers">Design Process</h3>
      <p className="website-page-p">I will create multiple sketches for a given logo. I will do my best to keep you updated as I work as it is important to have your input before as well as during the design process. Things like color and font are important to get just right as they will establish a brand for your business!</p>
